# Projects Overview
This is a repo I created to illustrate some data analytics projects that I have already completed to show what 
I am capable of in the data science field as an R programmer.

The R code and R Markdown files I share here are projects that I completed unguided through Datacamp
to demonstrate my skill in analyzing data in R.

Here are the descriptions of the projects as named in each file folder.  I used content from Datacamp to describe these projects, so credit goes to Datacamp for creating the content that I used to reference to describe each project.

## Candy Crush Saga Project Description
Candy Crush Saga is a hit mobile game developed by King (part of Activision|Blizzard) that is played by millions of people all around the world.

In this Project, I worked with a real Candy Crush dataset and used this data to estimate level difficulty. This Project assumes you can manipulate data frames using dplyr and make plots using ggplot2.


## Food Price Forecasts Project Description
This project required the use of writing functions make the analyses more readable and more repeatable. In this project, I performed an analysis of food prices in Rwanda, then wrapped my code into functions in order to apply my analysis to other food types.

Throughout the project, the ability to import, wrangle, manipulate, and forecast data were required.

## Rise and Fall of Programming Languages Project Description

How can you tell what programming languages and technologies are used by the most people? How about what languages are growing and which are shrinking, so that you can tell which are most worth investing time in? One excellent source of data is Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/), a programming question and answer site with more than 16 million questions on programming topics. By measuring the number of questions about each technology, you can get an approximate sense of how many people are using it. In this project, I used open data from the Stack Exchange Data Explorer (https://data.stackexchange.com/) to examine the relative popularity of languages like R, Python, Java and Javascript have changed over time.

Exploring the Kaggle Data Science Survey Project Description
I explored the 2017 Kaggle Data Science Survey results, which provides insights into the tools used by 10,000+ people in the professional data science community.

To do this project, you have to be comfortable manipulating data frames and have some experience working with the tidyverse packages dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2.

This project uses a subset of the 2017 Kaggle Machine Learning and Data Science Survey dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2017?utm_medium=partner&utm_source=datacamp.com&utm_campaign=ml+survey+case+study; full report --> https://www.kaggle.com/amberthomas/kaggle-2017-survey-results?utm_medium=partner&utm_source=datacamp.com&utm_campaign=ml+survey+case+study).

## Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing Project Description
In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made a breakthough discovery: he discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.  In this project, I reanalyze the data behind how Dr. Semmelweis discovered the importance of handwashing using R.

## Visualizing COVID-19 Project Description
Within months, COVID-19 went from an epidemic to a pandemic. From the first identified case in December 2019, how did the virus spread so fast and widely? In this free R project, I visualize data from the early months of the coronavirus outbreak to see how this virus grew to be a global pandemic.

This project required me to manipulate data frames using dplyr and make plots using ggplot2.

## Wrangling and Visualizing Musical Data
How do musicians choose the chords they use in their songs? Do guitarists, pianists, and singers gravitate towards different kinds of harmony?

We can uncover trends in the kinds of chord progressions used by popular artists by analyzing the harmonic data provided in the McGill Billboard Dataset [https://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/research/The_McGill_Billboard_Project_(Chord_Analysis_Dataset)]. This dataset includes professionally tagged chords for several hundred pop/rock songs representative of singles that made the Billboard Hot 100 list between 1958 and 1991. Using the data-wrangling tools available in the dplyr package, and the visualization tools available in the ggplot2 package, I explored the most common chords and chord progressions in these songs, and contrast the harmonies of some guitar-led and piano-led artists to see where the "affordances" of those instruments may affect the chord choices artists make.

## Visualizing Inequalities in Life Expectancy

Do women live longer than men? How long? Does it happen everywhere? Is life expectancy increasing? Everywhere? Which is the country with the lowest life expectancy? Which is the one with the highest? In this project, I answered all these questions by manipulating and visualizing United Nations life expectancy data using ggplot2.

The dataset can be found here (http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=GenderStat&f=inID:37&c=1,2,3,4,5,6&s=crEngName:asc,sgvEngName:asc,timeEngName:desc&v=1) and contains the average life expectancies of men and women by country (in years). It covers four periods: 1985-1990, 1990-1995, 1995-2000, and 2000-2005.

## Scout your Athletics Fantasy Team

If you were scouting out an athletics team, you would need to know more than just how far each person has jumped or thrown once. You want to know who is the most consistent, who fouls the least and who comes through in the clutch. And you will need to decide which aspects are most important to you so you can find the right balance.

In this R project, I used dataframes and the dplyr package to find out who you should put on your team, and in doing so become the next "Moneyball" star manager of an athletics team.

I used performance data collated from jumps and throws events in the US from 2013-2017.

## What Your Heart Rate Is Telling You

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Researchers are using several data mining techniques to help health care professionals in the diagnosis of heart disease. In this project, I examined the relationship between the maximum heart rate one can achieve during exercise and the likelihood of developing heart disease. Using multiple logistic regression, I handled the confounding effects of age and gender.

This project uses the Cleveland heart disease dataset.

## Predict Taxi Fares with Random Forests

In this project, I worked with the data from a large number of taxi journeys in New York from 2013. I used regression trees and random forests to predict the value of fares and tips, based on location, date and time. This project shows my experience with the packages dplyr, ggplot2 and randomForests.

The dataset used in this project is a sample from the complete 2013 NYC taxi data (https://chriswhong.com/open-data/foil_nyc_taxi/), which was originally obtained and published by Chris Whong.

## 538's Halloween Candy Rankings

This project is all about Halloween candy! I explored FiveThirtyEight's Halloween Candy dataset (https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/) and learned what kinds of data it contains. I then fitted and evaluated linear and logistic regression models. 

## Who Is Drunk and When in Ames, Iowa?

Using data collected from the State of Iowa, I grouped, summarized, and visualized data on breath alcohol tests in Ames, Iowa, (home of Iowa State University) from 2013-2017. Some questions I answered included, "What is the highest recorded value?" and "When do breath alcohol tests occur most?"

## Drunken Datetimes in Ames, Iowa

In the Who Is Drunk and When in Ames, Iowa? project, I looked at breathalyzer test data from the State of Iowa. In this project, I will proceeded to uncover temporal trends in the Ames breath alcohol data.

This project required familiarity with lubridate, dplyr, and ggplot2 packages. I manipulated the dates and times in the breath alcohol data to answer questions such as, "What day has the most tests?", "at which hour of the day are breath alcohol tests most common?", and "are blood alcohol content (BAC) results higher on days when Iowa State University's football team plays?"  This project included the use of the package ggridges to create insightful plots on the distribution of breath alcohol tests by hours of the day across the dataset.

# SAMHSA Substance Use Treatment Admissions Data and CDC Overdose Deaths Data

I utilize R to manipulate data tables published by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on substance use treatment admissions, and overdose deaths, respectively. I fit linear regression models to the data and discuss implications of the research.

Unfortunately, I am not able to include the files I worked with for this analysis due to their size.

You are able to download the same files I used from the websites above. It is a bit tedious but after about 20-30 clicks you should have them all
