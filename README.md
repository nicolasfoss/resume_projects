# resume_projects
This is a repo I created to illustrate some data analytics projects that I have already completed to show what 
I am capable of in my search for a job in the data science field as an R programmer.

The R code and R Markdown files I share here are projects that I completed unguided through Datacamp
to demonstrate my skill in analyzing data in R.
